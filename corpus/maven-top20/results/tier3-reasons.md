- (1) G:A names `testsuite/integration-arquillian/servers/app-server/jboss/galleon/pom.xml`, which only profile `app-server-eap8` of `testsuite/integration-arquillian/servers/app-server/jboss` lists, and that profile is not active on this machine (activate it with Maven's `-P` and re-import, or list the module at the top level); the lock would fetch it from a repository, where a reactor module is not published, so the dependency was not written.
