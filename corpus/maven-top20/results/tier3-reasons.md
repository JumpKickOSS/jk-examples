## import Tier 3 (not imported)

- (2) packaging `war` (`maven-war-plugin`) is not supported: jk builds jars, Boot jars and native images. Keep building this module with `jk mvn package`.

- (1) G:A N.Final` is pinned by the POM, and no repository the lock reads (jboss-public-repository, central, jumpkick, google) lists G:A at all; `jk lock` refuses it. Pin a version a repository lists, or declare the repository that publishes N.Final in `[repositories]`.

  repos: jenkins
- (1) G:A names `testsuite/integration-arquillian/servers/app-server/jboss/galleon/pom.xml`, which only profile `app-server-eap8` of `testsuite/integration-arquillian/servers/app-server/jboss` lists, and that profile is not active on this machine (activate it with Maven's `-P` and re-import, or list the module at the top level); the lock would fetch it from a repository, where a reactor module is not published, so the dependency was not written.  
  repos: keycloak
- (1) G:A names `testsuite/integration-arquillian/servers/app-server/jboss/wildfly/pom.xml`, which only profile `app-server-wildfly` of `testsuite/integration-arquillian/servers/app-server/jboss` lists, and that profile is not active on this machine (activate it with Maven's `-P` and re-import, or list the module at the top level); the lock would fetch it from a repository, where a reactor module is not published, so the dependency was not written.  
  repos: keycloak
- (1) `<build><extensions>` G:A builds only the modules git shows as changed, a selection `jk build` makes from its own action cache; nothing is written for it. Drop it from the POM when the jk build does not need it, or keep running that step with `jk mvn`.  
  repos: tutorials
- (1) `<build><extensions>` G:A is the `maven-archetype` packaging, a project template jk does not build; nothing is written for it. Drop it from the POM when the jk build does not need it, or keep running that step with `jk mvn`. (4 modules: extensions/amazon-lambda/maven-archetype, extensions/amazon-lambda-http/maven-archetype, extensions/amazon-lambda-rest/maven-archetype, …)  
  repos: quarkus
- (1) `<build><extensions>` G:A is the ssh transport of `mvn deploy`; `jk publish` speaks HTTP(S), `s3://` and `gs://`; nothing is written for it. Drop it from the POM when the jk build does not need it, or keep running that step with `jk mvn`.  
  repos: thingsboard
- (1) `<build><extensions>` G:A reports the Maven build to CI; the build's outputs do not depend on it; nothing is written for it. Drop it from the POM when the jk build does not need it, or keep running that step with `jk mvn`. Declared by the root pom.xml, inherited by 1,057 modules.  
  repos: quarkus
- (1) `<modules>` are declared only in profiles that are not active on this machine (default-jdk8, default-heavy, integration-jdk8, integration-heavy, default-jdk17, default, default-jdk22, default-jdk23, default-jdk24, default-jdk25, default-jdk26, integration-jdk17, integration, integration-jdk22, integration-jdk23, integration-jdk24, integration-jdk25, integration-jdk26, live-all, parents, default-disabled, integration-disabled); no module was imported, so the workspace builds nothing. Activate one with Maven's `-P` and re-import, or list the modules at the top level.  
  repos: tutorials
- (1) `<type>exe</type>` on G:A names an artifact jk has no manifest spelling for; the dependency was not written. A jar of the same module is `{ group, name, version }`, a classified jar adds `classifier`.

- (1) `<type>exe</type>` on G:A names an artifact jk has no manifest spelling for; the dependency was not written. A jar of the same module is `{ group, name, version }`, a classified jar adds `classifier`. (7 modules: edqs, transport/http, transport/mqtt, …)

- (1) `<type>zip</type>` on G:A names an artifact jk has no manifest spelling for; the dependency was not written. A jar of the same module is `{ group, name, version }`, a classified jar adds `classifier`. (3 modules: test-framework/core, quarkus/tests/junit5, testsuite/integration-arquillian/servers/auth-server/quarkus)  
  repos: keycloak
- (1) `maven-shade-plugin` relocates org.apache.lucene → org.neo4j.shaded.lucene9; jk has no package relocation, so no jar this workspace builds carries the shaded packages, and `community/lucene-index` (31 files), `community/neo4j` (1 file), `community/dbms` (1 file), `community/community-it/index-it` (1 file) import them. Keep building this module with Maven — `jk mvn -pl community/lucene9-shaded install` publishes G:A into `~/.m2/repository` — and depend on that artifact from a `file://` repository over `~/.m2/repository` in place of the workspace edge.  
  repos: neo4j
- (1) packaging `war` (`maven-war-plugin`) is not supported: jk builds jars, Boot jars and native images. Keep building this module with `jk mvn package`.
